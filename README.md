## Developers

FMC Core exposes an API for mod developers to create their own FMC mods.

### External Mod Support

FMC Core's Elemental Aspects feature is fully compatible with items, blocks, and mobs supplied by other mods.
Compatibility is achieved via configuration extentions. Players may add their own configurations to their personal installs, but the FMC project aims to provide built-in support for as many mods as possible.

If you are a developer and wish to supply official configuration extentions for external mods please make a pull-request that adds your configuration data to <TODO: create config file>. See here <TODO: docs> for documentation.
